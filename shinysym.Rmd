US suicide rate map
=====================================

Column {.sidebar}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```{r}
## selection year
year = suicide %>% distinct(year) %>% pull()

selectInput(
  "select_year", 
  label = h3("select year"),
  choices = year, selected = "2007")

## selection gender
gender = suicide %>% distinct(gender) %>% pull()

radioButtons(
  "select_gender", 
  label = h3("Choose gender"),
  choices = gender, selected = "Female")
```

(See description page for more information.)

Column {.tabset}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### US map
```{r}
renderPlotly({ 
  geo = list(
        scope = 'usa',
        projection =  list(type = 'albers usa'),
        lakecolor = toRGB('white'))

  suicide_df = suicide %>% 
        filter(
          year == input$select_year,
          gender == input$select_gender
        ) 
  
  suicide_df %>%

    # add text

  ) %>%

         title = "Suicide rate in US")
})
```


### Discription

The Crude Suicide Rate map allows users to toggle between different years (1999-2017) and choose gender, demonstrating the changes in suicide rate over time and visualize regional differences across the U.S. The map demonstrates that there are significant changes over time and gender. 

The line plot on the right shows the change of total suicide rate by year in US. We can see a stable increase by year.

**Suicide Rate**: The number of suicide deaths cases per 100000 people.

Column {data-width=450}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### suicide number by year in US

```{r}

suicide_all = suicide %>% group_by(year,gender) %>% summarise(rate = sum(rate))


line = 
  suicide_all %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rate)) + geom_point(aes(color = gender)) + geom_line(aes(color = gender)) + theme_bw()

ggplotly(line)
```


State statistics by states
=====================================

selectInput(
  "select_choice", 
  label = h3("select choice"),
  choices = variable_types, selected = "suicide_rate_per100000")

## top n selection
number = clean_df %>% distinct(number) %>% pull()

### Discription

The **US map** allows users to choose the types of variables, visualizing regional differences across the U.S.  

The **bar plot** shows the intuitive number in different states.

Users are also allowed to choose **TOP n states** they want to explore in both plots.

The map includes visualization of distributions of the following **variables**: 

**Suicide rate (2017)**: The number of suicide deaths cases per 100000 people.

**Female proportion (2017)**: The proportion of Female.

**Male proportion (2017)**: The proportion of Male.

**Female Suicide rate (2017)**: The number of female suicide deaths cases per 100000 females.

**Male Suicide rate (2017)**: The number of male suicide deaths cases per 100000 males.

**Age 5-14 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 5-14.

**Age 15-24 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 15-24.

**Age 25-34 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 25-34.

**Age 35-44 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 35-44.

**Age 45-54 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 45-54.

**Age 55-64 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 55-64.

**Age 65-74 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 65-74.

**Age 75-84 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age 75-84.

**Age >85 (2017)**: The proportion of people between age over 85.

**Alcohol consumption (2017)**: Alcohol consumption per capita in gallons

**Marijuana usage (2017)**: Marijuana users percentage.

**Advanced degree (2017)**: The proportion of people who have advanced degree.

**Bachelors degree(2017)**: The proportion of people who have Bachelors degree.

**College degree (2017)**: The proportion of people who have College degree.

**Below college degree (2017)**: The proportion of people who have below college degree.

**GDP (2017)**: Gross Domestic Product.

**Guns number per capita (2017)**: Averaged guns number per capita.

**Guns number registered (2017)**: Averaged guns number registered
